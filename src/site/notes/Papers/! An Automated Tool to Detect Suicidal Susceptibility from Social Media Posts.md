Suicidal ElectraIt is engineered to determine suicidal or non-suicidal tendencies from a given sequence of words. At its core, "Suicidal-Electra" rests upon a foundation of deep learning and NLP. Its training encompasses a vast corpus of annotated text samples of both suicidal and non-suicidal expressions. By processing and learning from these examples, the model acquires a solid understanding of linguistic patterns associated with suicidal thoughts. This training equips the model with a deep understanding of language patterns, metaphors, and expressions often associated with feelings of despair.
