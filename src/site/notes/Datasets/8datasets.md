### Identifying Depression on Reddit: The Effect of Training Data

Some of the trustworthy data is already available: the data from English depression forums was collected by Pennebaker et al.(2008). However, that dataset only contains about 400 blog posts, which might not be enough for machine learning purposes. Therefore, I'm still looking for other sources - so far, I'm collecting posts from the subreddsubredditit (Reddit is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website) devoted to depression. Reddit data might not be as reliable, because often people there self-diagnose themselves, but most of the posts still convey a strong negative emotion.

I'm also looking for data on other health problems (it would be interesting to compare or attempt to classify)

I will, of course, pre-process the data before using it. It might also be necessary to set a fixed size to the texts when using them as input data.
