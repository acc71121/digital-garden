# Self-Reported Mental Health Diagnoses (SMHD) dataset

The SMHD (Self-Reported Mental Health Diagnoses) dataset consists of Reddit posts of users who have claimed to have been diagnosed with one or several of nine mental health conditions ("diagnosed users"), and matched control users. All posts made to mental health-related subreddits or containing keywords related to a mental health condition were removed from the diagnosed users' data; control users' data do not contain such posts due to the selection process.

SMHD contains nine mental health conditions with diagnosed users.
